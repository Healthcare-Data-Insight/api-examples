# EDI Parsing and Conversion Examples

This repo contains usage examples of [X12 EDI converter and parser](https://datainsight.health/products/edi-converter/) provided by [Healthcare Data Insight (HDI)](https://datainsight.health/).

Our parsers/converters are easy to use; they require no knowledge of EDI. 

You can use our [command-line converter](https://datainsight.health/docs/ediconvert-cli/) or [parsing API](https://datainsight.health/posts/edi-json/).

Following are the key features of the converter:

* Forget about "loops" and "segments" -- no knowledge of X12 EDI is necessary (837 and 835 transactions)
* Intuitive field and object names that speak your language
* All X12 codes ("qualifier codes") are translated into "plain English."
* 100% of fields are converted; nothing is left behind
* Automated lookup of descriptions for all healthcare code sets (ICD, NDC, CPT, etc.)
* Convert to JSON or CSV/Excel
